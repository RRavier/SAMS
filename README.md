# SAMS
Surface Analysis: Matching and Statistics

This is a package containing software that allows for simultaneous matching of surfaces as well as a degree of statistical analysis. Surfaces are assumed to be equivalent up to rigid deformation, making this package appropriate for anatomical surfaces and not for other datasets of interests such as SCAPE and FAUST.

Users will need to edit only a few scripts based on the location of their data and required parameter tuning, the code will do the rest of the work.

The software assumes that the surfaces are aligned and simply connected. The former can be handled with external software such as Auto3DGM.
